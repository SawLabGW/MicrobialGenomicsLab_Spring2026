    "We will use **Slack** to communicate, discuss, and disseminate information such as reading materials, videos,code snippets, etc. You will get an invitation to join a Slack group created for this course. While Blackboard works fine, due to the cross-listed nature of the course, sometimes it becomes very difficult to organize content across both courses on Blackboard. We will use Blackboard for grading and submission of assignments but for sharing of content and classroom communications, we will use Slack.\n",

    "We will also be learning to use **Github** to document your work and group projects. You should create a Github account where you will be able to host your code repositories either publicly or privately. I would highly encourage you to use Github to host project workflows or notes (such as Jupyter notebooks) as it keeps track of versions and you can roll back to an earlier version if you found mistakes in the latest version of your workflows."
