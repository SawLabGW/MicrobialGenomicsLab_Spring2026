    "\n",
    "This documentation system includes a collection of instructions on computational exercises designed for you throughout the semester. It is impossible to properly display the html pages of these instructions on Blackboard. Therefore, we will be using this website (https://microbialgenomicslab-spring2023.readthedocs.io) to correctly render computational code and instructions and you should be checking the updates weekly for new instructions for each week."
