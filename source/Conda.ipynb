    "### Install Miniconda\n",
    "Follow instructions for Mac or Linux (for those with Windows computers but Ubuntu installed). Choose the latest Python version (Python 3.13).\n",
    "\n",
    "For both **Mac** or **Windows/WSL**, I would recommend using the command line installer (files with .sh extensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Mac**, open your terminal, then type `cd` to make sure you are in your \"home\" directory. Then type `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh` (if you have Apple chip) or `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh` (if you have Intel chip) processors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then type one of the following commands depending on the file you downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "## for Apple chips\n",
    "chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh\n",
    "./Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh\n",

    "./Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Windows/WSL**, open your Ubuntu shell (right-click on the icon and run as Administrator). Then type:\n",

    "\n",
    "These commands will launch the Miniconda installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions along and make sure you say \"yes\" at the very end when it asked you if you want the installer to prepend it to path.\n",

    "### Install Bioconda\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Install bioconda by typing the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda config --add channels defaults\n",

    "\n",
    "conda config --set channel_priority strict\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands will add bioinformatics related tools “channels” to miniconda. Now, you should be able to search and install tools locally on your computer. Try install jupyter first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda search jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "conda install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",

    "Answer the prompts by typing a `y` if it asks you to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have configured the bioconda channels, most of the bioinformatics tools we will use in this course should be available for installation through `conda`."
